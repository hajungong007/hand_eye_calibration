* Class to estimate the transformation from a robot link (hand) to a camera 
* sensor frame (eye) [Hand-Eye-Calibration] using the method described in
* "Hand-Eye Calibration Using Dual Quaternions" by Konstantinos Daniilidis.
* It features a simple command line interface, the estimated transformations
* are printed to the command line as well.
* 
* subscribes:	- /hec/eye_position [geometry_msgs/Pose]: transformation grid->camera [rotation R_CG, position of origin of G in C
* 		- /hec/hand_position [geometry_msgs/Pose]: transformation hand->base  [rotation R_BH, position of origin of H in B
