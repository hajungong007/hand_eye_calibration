*
* This class estimates the camera position from a rectified camera image with
* a checkerboard for a calibrated camera using OpenCV. The image with the
* detected checkerboard pattern is published to provide a feedback for
* calibration purposes.
* 
* subscribes:	- /camera/image_rect [sensor_msgs/Image]: Rectified camera image, e.g. published by image_proc
* 		- /camera/camera_info [sensor_msgs/CameraInfo]: Camera info data, published by the camera driver
* 
* services:	- hec_eye_pose [hand_eye_calibration::CameraPose]: data about the current pose
* 		   ->including:
* 			- pose_found [bool]: whether a pose was found
* 			- request_stamp [time]: id for the request that was answered
* 			- pose [geometry_msgs/Pose]: the transformation (see the explanation on the /hec/eye_position topic)
* 			- image [sensor_msgs/Image]: the image from which the transformation was obtained
* 			- point_coordinates [Point2D[]]: the positions of the pattern in the image
* 		- hec_eye_node_info [hand_eye_calibration::CameraPoseInfo]: information about the camera and calibration pattern
* 		   ->including:
* 		   	- camera_info [sensor_msgs/CameraInfo]: camera info data for the camera used (from camera topic)
* 			- pattern_coordinates [geometry_msgs/Point[]]: 3D coordinates of the calibration pattern used
* 
* publishes:	- /hec/eye_position [geometry_msgs/Pose]: The transformation from
* 		  checkerboard coordinates (O) to camera(eye) coordinates (E): the rotation
* 		  R_EO represented by a quaternion and the translation vector E_t_EO,
* 		  that is the coordinates of the origin of O in E coordinates.
* 		  Therefore, a transformation O->E would be carried out through:
* 		  x_E = R_EO*x_O + E_t_EO
* 
* Data needed on the parameter server (use either the command line or a yaml file):
* 		- /hec/checkerboard/squares_per_column (nr of internal chkrbrd edges per column)
* 		- /hec/checkerboard/squares_per_row (nr of internal chckrbrd edges per row
* 		- /hec/checkerboard/square_size (the size of checkerboard fields in [m])
